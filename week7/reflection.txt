In C, there are two ways to access an array, either with the [] operand or with the pointer arithmetic. By using pointer arithmetic, one advantage is that the array can be indexed and manipulated to shorten and lengthen the array. One disadvantage is that it's not as intuitive as using [] for arrays. Overall, I prefer to use the [] operands, as I have gotten used to them from coding in Java for so long, however I do want to get better at using the pointer arithmetic, as I think it will help me more in the future.
