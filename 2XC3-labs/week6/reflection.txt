In C, using the & operator allows one to access the address of a variable, rather than accessing the variable itself. This means that you could edit variables in other methods if needed, such as in the digits function in part 2 of lab 6.1. By sending addresses rather than variables, it also improves memory efficiency, allowing for less data needed to be transferred to perform a task. A disadvantage to using the & operator is its readability. It takes some time to get used to, as I was a bit confused using it for the firs time too. It also makes code harder to debug, as many problems can arise if there is a problem with the address or the variable. It can also have someone edit a variable they didn't want to edit, as this is something that is not common to see in other coding languages, which can then cause more errors to arise.
